### üëã Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile/resume!
My name is Luca Argolo and I'm currently a Computer Science student at [UFBA](https://ufba.br/).

I'm 23 years old and my current interests are in game development, modding, and procedural generation. 

I work part-time as a freelancer doing Minecraft mods and in my free time, I like to make and publish my own mods. I also like to occasionally play with some simple web development. 

### ‚õè Some of my Minecraft modding projects are:
 - [Kibe](https://github.com/lucaargolo/kibe) - A miscellaneous mod that adds a bunch of random QoL utilities to the game.
 - [Fabric Seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons) - A simple mod that adds seasons to the game, changing biomes as you play.
 - [Terrarian Slimes](https://github.com/lucaargolo/terrarian-slimes) - A mod strongly inspired by Terraria, that aims to add new slimes and useful items to the game.
 - [SlotLock](https://github.com/lucaargolo/slotlock) - A simple mod that lets you lock your inventory slots, so you don't accidentally store/trash an item.
 - [Lifts](https://github.com/lucaargolo/lifts) - A technology mod that adds various lifts for better vertical traversal inside your world.

You can download my mods at [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/d4rkness_king/projects) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/D4rkness_King)

### üåé Some of my web development projects are:
 - [Minha Grade](https://lucaargolo.github.io/minha-grade/) - A small website that generates an interactive curriculum based on a json file and lets you plan your classes grid.
 - [Trabalho IA](https://lucaargolo.github.io/trabalho-ia) - A college-assigned artificial intelligence project that lets you compare multiple algorithms solving Tic-Tac-Toe.
 - [Hist√≥rico de Voos](https://lucaargolo.github.io/historico-de-voos) - A college-assigned data science project with detailed flight info from 2015-2020 in Brazil.
 - [Trabalho Grafos](https://lucaargolo.github.io/trabalho-grafos) - A college-assigned graph theory project that lets you create a graph and visualize the Djkstra Algorithm working on it step by step.
 - [Random Planet Generator](https://lucaargolo.github.io/random-planet-generator/) - A javascript random planet generator, made in only 2 hours.
